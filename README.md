# Multi-Thread Debug Logger

## Overview
Multi-Thread Debug Logger is a lightweight and efficient logging system designed for embedded systems and low-resource environments. It enables real-time logging, debugging, and monitoring with minimal performance overhead.

## Features
- ðŸš€ **Lightweight & Efficient**: Optimized for embedded systems with minimal memory and CPU usage.
- ðŸ“¡ **Real-Time Logging**: Supports logging over serial, file storage, and network.
- ðŸ›  **Customizable Log Levels**: Allows filtering logs by severity (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR, etc.).
- ðŸ”Œ **Modular & Extensible**: Can be integrated into various embedded projects.
- ðŸ“Š **Formatted Output**: Supports structured log messages for easy parsing.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- C++ Compiler (GCC or Clang recommended)
- CMake (for build system configuration)
- Embedded hardware (e.g., STM32, ESP32) or simulator

### Steps
```sh
git clone https://github.com/MohHasan1/Embedded-Debug-Logging.git
cd Embedded-Debug-Logging
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Usage
### Basic Example
```cpp
#include "logger.h"

int main() {
    Logger log;
    log.info("System initialized");
    log.debug("Debugging mode enabled");
    log.error("Critical failure detected");
    return 0;
}
```

### Configuring Log Output
Modify `logger_config.h` to change the logging output method (e.g., Serial, File, or Network).
